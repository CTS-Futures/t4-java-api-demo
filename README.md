<h3 align="center">T4 Java API</h3>

#### Getting Started

You will need 2 things to get started with the example:

* A T4 account.
* A GitHub account to access the API library.

If you don't already have a T4 account go to https://cts.sim.t4login.com/register and register for a free Simulator account.

In order to reference our Java API package, you will need to create a GitHub personal access token (PAT). See the documentation:

- https://github.com/jamiebuilds/documentation-handbook/blob/master/README.md
- https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens

Create a classic PAT for reading packages.

You can add the GitHub PAT in one of two ways:

* Update build.gradle with it directly.
* Set it in an environment variable (see build.gradle)
